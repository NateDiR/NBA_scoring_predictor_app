# NBA Scoring Predictor #
### By: Nate DiRenzo 

## Statement of Need:
Sports bettors are always looking for tools to give them an edge. Here, we will create a model to predict NBA players' scoring performances, and make it available for public use with tools like Streamlit.
<br></br>
## Goal:
The goal of this project is to productionize a model that predicts NBA scoring performances for individual players. This is an extension of the work done in the Linear Regression and Web Scraping module, and the goal is to expand on that model, update it on a daily basis, and make it publicly available using tools like Google Cloud Platform and Streamlit.
<br></br>
## Success Metrics:
The metric for success is whether or not the model functions in production 
<br></br>
## Data Description:
Data is collected via webscraping the betting website, and the nba-api.
<br></br>
## Tools:
- Cloud Hosted Database or MongoDB
- BeatufilSoup and Selenium for Scraping
- NBA API for collecting player, team, game stats
- Google Colab for all-cloud
- Keras/Tensorflow/Scikit Learn
- Streamlit for hosting
<br></br>
## Models:
- Linear Regression Model
- RNN/LSTM
<br></br>
## MVP Goal:
Basic implimentation of the model running on local machine, and deployed to streamlit.
